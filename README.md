Crypto api rest automation

First of all I´ve registered me in required webpage and I´ve created a 2 an API key, configuruing this key with 2 factor
authentication.

Later I´ve created this github project

I´ve based in official API REST documentation to create required requests

I´ve not used behave (most popular BDD framework in Python) due to I had no skelethon available and I've had not too much time to complete the quiz

Update: Added implementation using behave and BDD strategy. All endpoint could be tested much deeper, but this code makes an idea how you have to approach to the problem.
